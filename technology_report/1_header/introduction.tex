\section{Purpose of the document}

\section{Description of the project}

\section{Abstract}
In this report we present the design and implementation of our realization of the Hypermedia Applications 2023 2024 Design and Development project.
The specification required us to develop a website for a center that deals with topics such as violence towards and mistreatment of women. As such,
the center provides services and is involved in projects that focus on education and/or support of possible victims. This document describes in detail
our implementation of the specification, starting from the design of content and navigation to the final presentation design and interaction scenarios.
