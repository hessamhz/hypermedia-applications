\section{Services used}
We chose to use Nuxt.js in SSR (Server-Side Rendering) mode for our project to enhance performance, improve SEO, and deliver a better user experience.
SSR allows the server to render the initial HTML of the application, which significantly reduces the time to first meaningful paint and improves load times for users, particularly those on slower connections.
This initial rendering on the server ensures that search engines can easily index the content of our pages, improving our site's SEO and making it more discoverable to potential users.
Additionally, SSR provides a more seamless experience as users navigate through the application, reducing the perceived load time and enhancing the overall responsiveness.

\section{Structure}
Structure of links/pages folder with short description

As for the structure of the project main folders, we referenced the Nuxt3 standard: the most external index file
contains the code of the homepage, while each page code is inside its own folder, with the same organization used for navigation.
For the pages of the single Service, Project and Person we used 'slug' .....
In order to maintain the same layout throughout the website we have also utilized layouts: a default one with header (navigation bar), body (page content) and footer;
and a 'no-footer' layout, that we used for the chatbot page specifically.

\section{Extra modules}
Table \ref{table:modules} introduces the modules we used throughout the project:
\begin{table}[h!]

            \begin{tabular}{|m{0.3\linewidth}|m{0.6\linewidth}|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Module} & \textbf{Use}\\
            \hline
                 \textit{Tailwind CSS} & CSS framework that enables faster styling and responsiveness without the need to write custom CSS.  \\
            \hline
                 \textit{eslint} & A static code analysis tool that makes code more consistent and avoids bugs by enforcing a set of style and formatting guidelines.  \\
            \hline
            \textit{nuxt-swiper} & Swiper is a modern touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions. It was used to implement a carousel-like presentation of comments/testimonials in the services pages.  \\
            \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Imported Packages}
            \label{table:modules}
\end{table}

\section{SEO}
Each webpage implements the \texttt{useSeoMeta()} method to define SEO metadata. The metadata injected into each page is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\texttt{Title} (and \texttt{ogTitle})} of the current page and the name of the website;
	\item \texttt{Description} of the current page;
	\item \texttt{ogType} defines the type of content being displayed.
	\item \textbf{\texttt{ogUrl} (and \texttt{canonical})} define the main url of the website.
	\item \texttt{ogSiteName} defines the name of the website.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of Web Development and Design and we cared about making our
website as inclusive as possible. For this reason we referenced the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) basic principles and rules
as early as the User Interface Design stage.

\vspace{1em}
We mainly focused on color-contrast, alternate-text for images and aria-labels for interactable elements.
We utilized the tools 'WAVE' and 'Lighthouse' in order to check for possible issues and to calibrate better our
implementation as to increase accessibility, especially for the main functionalities of our website.
This perspective allowed us to also increase by extension the general usability.
Of course these tools are extremely useful but not perfect, and we took care of limit cases by using common sense.

\section{Additional features}
One of the nice features we have implemented is related to the chatbot.
By using the localStorage we could store the thread\_id of the conversation with the OpenAI assistant, and use it to have meaningful context-aware conversations.
No matter if you go to another page, close the tab or even the browser, the conversation will be saved and you can continue it from where you left off.
You are also able to delete the conversation history at any time.
