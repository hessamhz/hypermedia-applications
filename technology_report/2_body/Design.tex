\subsection{Interaction Scenarios}
%Description
\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Alessia M. is a 32 year old woman that has recently came out of an abusive relationship with her boyfriend of 7 years. 
She knows that her healing process is going to take a long time and that she will need help through it. 
A friend suggests her to check out The Hive, and mentions to her that the Center offers a psychological counseling service 
that could help her. She starts by checking out the website: scrolling through the homepage she finds a link to the about page 
of The Hive and reads through to get an idea of what the center is about. Satisfied with what she reads she uses the navigation 
bar (landmarks) to find the service her friend talked to her about. Sure enough in the list of services there is the “Counseling 
and Psychological Support”, she navigates to the single Service Page through the “Read More” (group link) and reads through the 
additional information and testimonials, and decides to give it a try next Friday.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
A close friend of Paola S. has been struggling for some time at her workplace because of a colleague’s behavior towards here. 
Paola knows that her friend has been consistently belittled and mistreated, and wants to find out how she can help her considering 
the situation. She knows about The Hive and remembers that the center has recently added a risk assessing chat bot, so she decides 
to try it, in order to better understand the severity of her friend's situation. Once on the homepage of the website she directly 
goes for the link to the chatbot on the navigation bar (landmarks). 
She chats for a bit with Bee, describing the situation of her friend and answering the questions Bee asks her. 
Bee gives her a few suggestions and possible contacts that could help her friend.

\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Giovanni L. is the principal of a middle school based in Milan. Recently one of the teachers in his school has mentioned that she 
wanted to organize a seminar to sensitize the students about the topic of gender inequality for the occasion of the International 
Women’s day. For this purpose she gave him the name of a contact she knows from the center The Hive.  Giovanni goes into the center’s 
website and through the navigation bar (landmarks) he easily finds the “Who we are” page. Here he browses to find “Filippo Pantaleone” 
(group link), the contact of his colleague, and looks through his Profile page. Utilizing the sidebar links (structural links) he finds 
the activities Filippo is responsible for and follows the link to the project “ARYA, To Counter Gender Stereotypes”, which is perfect for 
what he’s looking for. He decides then to contact the center through the apposite section on the website.
