\section{Introduction}
In this section the workflow and results of the User Testing phase are presented and discussed.

This phase required asking new users to surf on the UNICEF and complete a series of tasks while being observed by the group components. The main objective was to confirm the critical flaws and issues detected during the Inspection phase and discover new ones thanks to unpredictability of behavior of a tester.

\section{Design of the study}
\subsection{User profiles}
% TODO explain the user profile

\subsection{Tasks}
In the previous chapter, we highlighted a set of heuristics and questions that failed to score an average higher than \textbf{2,5} points out of 5. We present them here for simplicity:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{N1.2} Does the website provide breadcrumbs to define the user position?
	\item \textbf{N3.2} Does the website allow the user to correctly navigate back to a previous section or page?
	\item \textbf{N4.1} Is the website consistent with wording, visual and routing elements?
	\item \textbf{N7.1} Does the website offer shortcuts to common functions?
	\item \textbf{N7.2} Does the website allow customization and personalization of interaction, catering to both expert and novice users?
	\item \textbf{N8.1} Is the website exempt from unnecessary information or links?
	\item \textbf{N10.1} Is the documentation of the website, when provided, searchable and navigable?
	\item \textbf{MN1} Interaction consistency
	\item \textbf{MN2} Group navigation-1
\end{itemize}
