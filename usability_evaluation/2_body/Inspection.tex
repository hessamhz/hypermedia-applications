\section{Introduction}
In this section the workflow and results of the Inspection Evaluation are presented and discussed.

The task was to act as experts to evaluate the quality and usability of a website assigned by the evaluators of the course. What follows is an introduction to the content of the website, and a presentation of the heuristics used, with the agreement on the scale and scores applied. A comment on the results is finally presented.

The website has been preliminary checked. A series of question, if not already provided, have been drafted for a set of heuristics to assess. A form has been created to collect the scores by each reviewer. Finally scores and comments have been checked to discover critical flaws or issues with the website.

\section{Overview of the Website}
The website assigned for the June/July call is \underline{\url{www.unicef.org}}.

UNICEF, or the United Nations Children’s Fund, is a United Nations agency responsible for providing humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide. Founded in 1946, UNICEF’s mission is to advocate for the protection of children’s rights, to help meet their basic needs, and to expand their opportunities to reach their full potential. UNICEF operates in over 190 countries and territories, focusing on areas such as child protection, education, immunization, healthcare, nutrition, and emergency relief.

The website presents a virtually infinite amount of information about the activity of the Agency: it presents News and Stories regarding the initiatives taken; Programs addressing various field, Donations which fund the organization; Resources to get involved as a volunteer or worker.

\section{Heuristics}
\textbf{Usability inspection} is the name for a set of methods where an evaluator inspects a user interface.
The evaluation is enabled by the application of the so called Heuristic-driven evaluation technique, a set of principles and checklists that focus on various areas to help discovering potential flaws and issues.


\subsection{Nielsen}
Nielsen heuristics, formulated by Jakob Nielsen, are a set of ten general principles for user interface design, introduced in 1989, updated in 1994, finalized in 2005. They are widely used as guidelines for evaluating and improving the usability of a system.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{N1 Visibility of system status} Are the states of the on-going processes of the website always clear? Does the website provide breadcrumbs to define the user position? Does the website use visual elements to highlight user interaction?
	\item \textbf{N2 Match between system and the real world} Does the website use understandable language for its main functionalities? Does the website include icons and assets that are familiar and resemble the real world?
	\item \textbf{N3 User control and freedom} Does the website allow the user to revert or cancel an action? Does the website allow the user to correctly navigate back to a previous section or page? Does the website allow the user to close additional windows at all times?
	\item \textbf{N4 Consistency and standards} Is the website consistent with wording, visual and routing elements? Is the placement of the main components consistent throughout different pages?
	\item \textbf{N5 Error prevention} Are user's inputs, when required, checked for correctness? Does the website provide options to insert information in a guided manner?
	\item \textbf{N6 Recognition rather than recall} Are the website's commands and functionalities visible or easily retrievable when needed? Does the website suggest a set of options to select from for navigation?
	\item \textbf{N7 Flexibility and efficiency of use} Does the website offer shortcuts to common functions? Does the website allow customization and personalization of interaction, catering to both expert and novice users?
	\item \textbf{N8 Aesthetic and minimalist design} Is the website exempt from unnecessary information or links? Are aesthetic choices prioritizing the core elements of the website?
	\item \textbf{N9 Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors} Does the website present errors in a user-friendly manner? Does an error state of the website give clear instructions on how to fix/recover from it?
	\item \textbf{N10 Help and documentation} Is the documentation of the website, when provided, searchable and navigable?
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that the questions are the result of a meeting in which the inspectors brainstormed questions that would answer the given heuristics and agreed the final ones presented in this document.

\subsection{MiLe (Milan Lugano)}
The MiLE heuristics are an extension of Nielsen’s original heuristics, tailored to address specific issues related to web usability. Each heuristics tries to answer given questions (that are shown in the following list). Only a subset of the 40+ heuristics has been used.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Content subset}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{MC1 Information overload} Is the information in a page too much or too little?
			\item \textbf{MC2 Consistency of page content structure} Do pages that present topics of the same category have the same types of elements?
			\item \textbf{MC3 Contextualized information} Do the pages include information that help users understand where they are?
			\item \textbf{MC4 Content organization (hierarchy)} Is the hierarchical organization of topics appropriate for the topics relevance?
		\end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Navigation/Interaction subset}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{MN1 Interaction consistency} Do pages of the same type have the same navigation links and interaction capability?
			\item \textbf{MN2 Group navigation-1} It is easy to navigate from/among groups of “items”, and within the items?
			\item \textbf{MN3 Group navigation-2} Do menus create Cognitive Overload?
			\item \textbf{MN4 Structural navigation} Is it easy to navigate among the “components” (“parts”) of a topic?
			\item \textbf{MN5 Semantic navigation} Is it easy to navigate from a topic to a related one (in both directions)?
			\item \textbf{MN6 Landmarks} Are “Landmarks” effective for the user to reach the “key” (most relevant) parts of the web site?
		\end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Presentation subset}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{MP1 Text layout} Is the text readable? Is the font size appropriate?
			\item \textbf{MP2 Interaction placeholders-semiotics} Interactive elements are “intuitive”?
			\item \textbf{MP3 Interaction placeholders-consistency} Textual or visual labels of interactive elements are consistent in terms of wording, shape, color, position, etc.
			\item \textbf{MP4 Consistency of Visual Elements} In pages of the same type do visual elements have the same visual properties?
			\item \textbf{MP5 Hierarchy-1} Is the on-screen allocation of contents within a page appropriate for their relevance?
			\item \textbf{MP6 Hierarchy-2} Is the on-screen allocation of visual elements appropriate for their relevance?
			\item \textbf{MP7 Spatial allocation-1} Are “Semantically related” elements close to each other?
			\item \textbf{MP8 Spatial allocation-2} Are "Semantically distant” element placed distant from each other?
			\item \textbf{MP9 Consistency of Page Spatial Structure} Do pages of the same type have the same spatial organization for the various visual elements?
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Execution of the inspection}
\subsection{Inspection Sheet}
An inspection sheet (in the form of a Google Form) was used to collect the scores and comments from each inspector. The form has been divided into sections (as shown in Figures \ref{fig:nielsenForm} and \ref{fig:mileForm}) in representing the current subset of Heuristics being used to evaluate the website: Nielsen; MiLE: Content; MiLE: Navigation; MiLE: Presentation. Each section contains a subsection per-heuristics, which in turns contain a input field for each of the questions that are linked to the current heuristic. Next to each question a field to add comments about the score is also provided.

\subsection{Scale and scores}
The scale that was agreed among inspectors is the 1-5 scale, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 represents \textit{Strongly disagree}
	\item 5 represents \textit{Strongly agree}
\end{itemize}
Adding more granularity to the choice by means of the 1-10 scale would make inspection and results' evaluation harder, so the 1-5 scale felt like a good balance between quality and simplicity of the evaluation for its inspectors.
Finally, each question has been made not-mandatory to manage such cases in which an inspector would realize a given question or heuristic was not applicable in the context of the UNICEF website.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Constraints on the inspection}
To maintain consistency in the evaluation of the heuristic throughout different pages, we agreed that a better suited option would be to evaluate a category of heuristics on multiple pages at the same time. Given the size of the website to evaluate, so the difficulty in defining a proper amount of pages to visit (per heuristic), we decided to set that amount at maximum 50 pages. Also time constraints were not imposed.

It should be noted that some sub-websites (such as the one to file an application for a career within UNICEF etc.) were ignored during the evaluation. We decided to focus on websites that would provide knowledge and content regarding the Agency activity, rather than evaluating applications which represent a really small part of the entire website.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Final scores} \label{subsec:final_score}
After the Inspection phase, we reviewed the scores and discussed the results. We decided to define the final scores as the averages of the partial scores and also defined a baseline over which the score would be considered acceptable. A score below a baseline of \textbf{2,5} would mean that further investigation would explicitly target the associated heuristic or question. We decided to comment on the results of this phase during the next phase of User Testing to be able to compare the data and extract more meaningful insights.

Tables \ref{tab:N_final_scores}, \ref{tab:MC_final_scores}, \ref{tab:MN_final_scores}, \ref{tab:MP_final_scores} show the final scores for each heuristic and question:

\subsection{Commented Screenshots}
In this section we highlight, with the help of visual examples, the main critical points that we identified with the usability inspection.

\textbf{N1.2} and \textbf{MN2} refer to the usage of breadcrumbs in the website. As shown in figure \ref{fig:N1.2}, while present, the way breadcrumbs are handled in the UNICEF website is unfamiliar and
inconsistent throughout the website. In fact, they are present only on specific sections and pages, not all of them.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/critical_heuristics/MN2.png}
    \captionof{figure}{Example of Breadcrumbs in the UNICEF website} \label{fig:N1.2}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{N3.2} is concerned with the presence of buttons and options for the user to correctly navigate back to a previous section or page. One of the most critical aspect that we found with our evaluation was the way
the website handles navigation back to the main website. It often occurs during browsing to end up in a new sub-domain of the original website. The only option to go back is the UNICEF Global button (fig. \ref{fig:N3.2b}) in the top right corner.
This button is easy to miss and isn't very clear about what it does. It is also positioned in a counter-intuitive place.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/critical_heuristics/N3.2a.png}

    \hfill

        \caption{Different layout with no back button}
        \label{fig:N3.2b}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\textbf{N4.1} focus on the consistency of wording, visual and routing elements. We noticed that there are numerous inconsistencies between sub-domains and the main website. Even elements and sections that we would expect
to be identical looked the same but were completely different. Landmarks changed in structure and names and even call to actions were not the same. This difference in functionalities is especially critical if we consider it
paired with an almost identical UI as the main website, which creates confusion in the expectations of the user.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/critical_heuristics/N4.1a.png}

        \caption{Same sections but different elements in a different sub-domain}
        \label{fig:4.1b}
    \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{N7.1-2} are related to shortcuts and personalization of interaction. Except for some changes in language and presentation (contrast option) there are no real options for personalization.
The main action (donate) is instead always present as a direct shortcut to the dedicated page. Another useful shortcut for the homepage is the logo in the header. Other than this, there were no relevant options for personalization.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/critical_heuristics/N7.1 N7.2.png}
	\caption{Example of shortcuts and personalization options}
	\label{fig:N7.1 N7.2}
\end{figure}

\textbf{N8.1} is concerned with usefulness of the content of a page. Every page of the website, especially articles and posts, show a lot of content, either textual or multi-medial.
While this is probably a choice moved by the goal of transparency in the information given, it still makes it overwhelming to navigate through. Each article provides a good amount of
references to other articles, even in the middle of a page, distracting easily the user.

\section{Conclusions}
The UNICEF website has the purpose to deliver as much information and details as possible about the activity of this Agency to its readers for transparency in the operations and actions taken. Another goal is to convince potential new and recurring donators to help with UNICEF's cause and inspire the next generation of volunteers and workers at this agency.

The sheer amount of content provided is not properly organized so the user could easily get lost while surfing this website. The content is often not separated into proper sections, sub-domains make usability a nightmare and apparently no guidelines exist to define what links and buttons should point to or do. Breadcrumbs are not correctly used (if they are presented anyway) and the user could get easily lost into the ocean of content presented to them.

From these results, it's clear that the main problem is the many ways in which many informations are presented and the ways in which these information can be reached. The additional problem is that many times the content is pages at different levels even though these levels are supposed to be the same.
