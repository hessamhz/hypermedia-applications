\section{Introduction}
In this Appendix the individual scores and comments for each inspector are presented. Each section represents a different set of Heuristics. For simplicity, only the names of the inspectors are showed in each table. In the top row we introduce the Heuristic being evaluated, then the question the comments and score are referencing to is presented.

\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Are the states of the on-going processes of the website always clear?}} \\
\hline
Hessam & 3 & Beside the breadcrumbs (which is not always present). Even inside the nested pages, the only way to understand what is going on is looking for the headlines.  \\
\hline
Filippo & 5 & Both Donate and Job Application processes provide useful breadcrumbs that signal the state of the process. \\
\hline
Mobina & 4 & The donation page lacks immediate feedback after clicking "Donate," causing user confusion  \\
\hline
Virginia & 5 & For example when you're making a donation you get an intuitive screen for the steps to accomplish which gives an idea of the state you're in in the process \\
\hline

%N1.2
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website provide breadcrumbs to define the user position? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 3 & breadcrumbs were mostly provided but sometimes it has a '+' sign on the parents. this feature is not shown on the actual parent node but the first one (after home) (example: \url{https://www.unicef.org/protection/harmful-practices}). This feature is also not available everywhere (e.g. emergencies).   \\
\hline
Filippo & 2 & Mixed feelings: sometimes they're presented, sometimes they're not. When presented, they don't offer the full path that was used to reach a given page. Clicking Home brings back to home-page, instead of the. "What we do" section from which pages that present this specific breadcrumbs are suggested. Sometimes a breadcrumb button brings forward into a sub-page, rather than back to a parent page, there's no apparent way to go back to a parent page \\
\hline
Mobina & 3 & Breadcrumbs are used inconsistently across the site, with some sections having them and others not. when you click on some parts in navigation bar, it will lead you to a point of no return that you can not find the parent node (ex. supply and logistic)  \\
\hline
Virginia & 2 & The website does have breadcrumbs but they are only available on some specific pages and sub-categories. Overall even when available they are not very detailed in describing how the user reached the specific page they're in \\
\hline

%N1.3
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website use visual elements to highlight user interaction?}} \\
\hline
Hessam & 4 & "The only visual elements present is one single line under selected main tabs and arrows being reverted when focused on which was inside only section. (only in donation there is a color change for selected items).
The other part was when selecting a news that the pictures get zoomed and the texts were underlined which felt lackluster. The rest of visual insights were only texts being underlined."   \\
\hline
Filippo & 4 & Most of the interactive elements (such as menus, links, etc. animate to convey the presence of an action that changes the page significantly). Such animations are not present in some still images that are supposed to be buttons, while other buttons are animated or change appearance when hovering (see \url{https://www.unicef.org/child-protection)})\\
\hline
Mobina & 4 & there are visual changes such as color change, underline when hovering over clickable elements also there is visual changes in buttons when they are clicked or pressed, indicating that the click has been registered. Interacting with input field in donation part has visual cues by changing the color of the input box. Also whenever you are willing to leave the donation page without actually donating or not be able to donate because of the error of the website you will see a feedback on Actions. But I could not find any interactive element such as maps or sliding pictures.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 3 & Overall it is shown when the user is hovering on some elements with brief animations (zoom on picture of articles, blue bar under navigation boxes). In general it is little visible or non present. \\

%N2.1
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website use understandable language for its main functionalities? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 5 & For most of the parts it has used a simple language. Note that this was only evaluated in English.  \\
\hline
Filippo & 4 & All buttons include text in some way (except for a few exceptions, such as the share button which uses a share that's usually associated with sharing, but uses an icon style typical of the Flutter or Material design systems, so iOS/Mac users might not know about it). Also, again, some buttons are not appear as buttons at all as they're clickable images. \\
\hline
Mobina & 4 &  Content is written in clear and straightforward language, buttons such as "Donate" and "Join Us" effectively communicate their purpose. But, Error messages do not indicate specific issues.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 5 & For example when you're making a donation you get an intuitive screen for the steps to accomplish which gives an idea of the state you're in in the process \\

\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website include icons and assets }} \\
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{that are familiar and resemble the real world? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 4 & The icons which were used were decent and normal. The only downside was the quantity, the number of icons in the website was fairly limited.   \\
\hline
Filippo & 4 & Yes and no. The search and share buttons use icons only. Some buttons represent the type of content they will present but are not visually and clearly marked as buttons.  \\
\hline
Mobina & 4 & Breadcrumbs are used inconsistently across the site, with some sections having them and others not. when you click on some parts in navigation bar, it will lead you to a point of no return that you can not find the parent node (ex. supply and logistic)  \\

\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website allow the user to revert or cancel an action? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 4 & Mostly it would satisfy. in this search page if I wanted to cancel my search there was no option beside reloading (\url{https://jobs.unicef.org/en-us/search/?search-keyword=sth\%20)}  \\
\hline
Filippo & 5 & Yes if it comes only to forms or guided actions to donate. The user is frequently asked to check their input and save the input for later revision.  \\
\hline
Mobina & 3 & Mostly yes for example in https://www.unicef.org/partnerships you can get back to the page. But as there is no consistency in style you do not have it in all pages for example donation or https://www.unicef.org/careers/get-prepared where you can not even get back to home page.  \\
\hline
Virginia & N/A & I haven't found any relevant cases that would make me have an opinion on this \\
\hline

% N3.2
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website allow the user to correctly }} \\
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{navigate back to a previous section or page? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 3 & For some parts yes. but when you for example click on the subdomains of the website (donation, data, jobs and etc) the back option does not bring you back to the unicef website.  (https://jobs.unicef.org/en-us/listing/), (https://data.unicef.org/)   \\
\hline
Filippo & 2 & Breadcrumbs are not always presented, they're inconsistent as they present buttons to go back to the main page and not to the page that caused the current one to open.   \\
\hline
Mobina & 2 & There is almost no back buttons or links that allow users to easily return to the previous page they visited and as the breadcrumbs are not used consistently it is not easy to navigate back to higher-level sections. In some pages suck as "supply and logistic" from navigation bar, the navigation bar would change completely and you cannot even find the homepage.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 1 & The main website is connected with multiple other domains that extend the original one (i.e.: careers ) and it's really not intuitive to understand how to get back from them. The link back to the main website is made through the "Unicef global" on the top right corner (I had to discover it by accident). There is also one specific case in which it's just impossible to go back (career login page). \\

Hessam & 5 & All the pop up pages have a proper closing button. although I have tested this on PC and not the responsive behavior.  \\
\hline
Filippo & N/A & No additional windows are presented. \\
\hline
Mobina & 5 & Close buttons (represented by an "X" icon) are consistently present on pop-ups, allowing users to dismiss them easily.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 5 & The only two cases of over-windows that I found (newsletter subscription form - couldn't replicate, and trying to get out of the donation website) had both x to close them \\

% N4.1
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Is the website consistent with wording, visual and routing elements? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 2 & The consistency between sub domains and the website is non-existent. For example the donation (\href{https://donazioni.unicef.it/?utm_source=uniceforg&utm_medium=unicef.org&_gl=1\%2Am6wyhc\%2A_ga\%2AMzQwMDE3Nzk5LjE3MTMzNjQ5NjE.\%2A_ga_ZEPV2PX419\%2AMTcxNDg0NTI1My40LjEuMTcxNDg0NzIwOC41Ni4wLjA.#/home}{\underline{Click here for an example}}) uses completely different assets. this pattern continues among all the main subsections of the website.  \\
\hline
Filippo & 2 & As already said, breadcrumbs are not consistent. Also some links bring to main pages, while others bring to sub-pages nested into a main-page's directory.  \\
\hline
Mobina & 2 & I would say one of the biggest downsides of this website in the inconsistency in any terms. It fails to maintain consistency in wording, visual elements, and routing elements. However some pages are similar to each other that is more like that is happened accidently!  \\
\hline
Virginia & 1 & Words are not always super familiar and I wouldn't really consider it very consistent \\
\hline

\pagebreak

% N4.2
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Is the placement of the main components consistent }} \\
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{throughout different pages? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 2 & The order and usage of components is not consistent although it is selected through a finite set of pools. for example here in (\href{https://www.unicef.org/immunization}{\underline{example here}}) it has a 'latest' section at the end. but a pretty similar page like (\href{https://unicef.org/nutrition}{\underline{example here}}) you see 'more from unicef' and 'recourses' as the substitute. this is just one of many cases within pages that the consistency is non-existent.    \\
\hline
Filippo & 4 & Except when moving to different websites (such as "careers" and "donation" website) and for breadcrumbs, the UI elements' positions are consistent around the website   \\
\hline
Mobina & 4 & Almost yes, also component placement adapts to different screen sizes. But in some pages such as "supply and logistic" ,"donation" and "career" the navigation bar or other main components changes completely.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 4 & The placement is overall pretty much the same, nav-bar glitches a bit in the homepage though, for some reason you have to scroll through the entire hero to see it again. The language options change position in articles. \\

\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Are user's inputs, when required, checked for correctness? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 2 & The validations are inconsistent for example for this page (\href{https://donazioni.unicef.it/?utm_source=uniceforg&utm_medium=unicef.org&_gl=1\%2Akvney7\%2A_ga\%2AMzQwMDE3Nzk5LjE3MTMzNjQ5NjE.\%2A_ga_ZEPV2PX419\%2AMTcxNDg0NTI1My40LjEuMTcxNDg0NzQzMC40OS4wLjA.#/home}{\underline{Example here}}) you can choose a number which is invalid for donation (-10) the error sometimes appear but a lot of the times it will not pop.

Also for the job search (\href{https://jobs.unicef.org/en-us/filter/?search-keyword=sth\%20&work-type=fellowship&location=cambodia&category=emergency&pay-scale=consultancy}{\underline{Example here}}) I would prefer the list to be limited if a position is not available instead of letting me to select whatever I want and say that just the job is not found.

This constraints were more polished in the data section.   \\
\hline
Filippo & 5 & At all times the user is presented with errors and correction actions if the input in form field is not valid (this is the case when applying for a job in the "careers" section).  \\
\hline
Mobina & 4 & Donation form validate inputs for correctness, displaying error messages for invalid data:"It is not possible to make a donation of less than €5" or inserting invalid email addresses : "The field must be an email address". But it will appears in any case of error even if you type word "e" in the input box or "-10". Also expect for "e" and "-" you can not insert any other character. Inserting more number than the phone number would not let you go for further actions but will not show you any errors as well.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 4 & I only got to check it for the newsletter form, it checks the validity of the email but not of the name and surname (numbers can be inserted), it does check the donation and communicates when it's not the minimum required (5 euro). \\

\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Does the website provide options to insert information }} \\
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{in a guided manner? }} \\
\hline
Hessam & 4 & It was suggesting default values for the donation and data. but for job search it was not there. you had to manually choose between a big set of options.     \\
\hline
Filippo & 3 & The careers website, for instance, provides calendars when inserting a date  \\
\hline
Mobina & 4 & for donation it was suggesting autofill for some parts. for work with us part there are some  options for guided information insertion such as: date input fields include a calendar widget for easy selection, for location, contract type, functional area and position level user can find default values. In "search for job" there is no option to insert information in a guided manner  \\

But  presenting them is not always in a user friendly manner. for instance, in the phone number field, in donation page, you can not see what is the problem of the number you have inserted. Also, each filed has it own specific error always for example if users insert "-10" or "123456765432345676543234567543456543" in the donation box they would get the same error: "It is not possible to make a donation of less than €5"  \\

Clicking on any type of link just redirects to that page but in the breadcrumbs it will still be shown as if you're coming from "home".

This is not well defined. for example on the 'What do we do' -> 'How do we do` -> `invovation` has no relation between any of the childeren and parents. even when you open it (https://www.unicef.org/innovation/) there is not even a bread crumb to follow to the parents.      \\

\hline
Mobina & 3 & The website has some issues with organizing topics. For example, different menu links on sub-pages often go to the same page at different levels of the site. This can confuse users, especially when there are no breadcrumbs or other ways to follow their path.  \\

The data section also has a completely different navbar.     \\

Virginia & 1 & Even though some pages may belong to the same category or sub category in the navigation menus, the types of links you can find inside are much different. Sometimes even the tabs that are styled in the same way actually contain links to different kinds of content. \\

Mobina & 2 & The website is highly inconsistent and frustrating to navigate. The navbar changes between sections, The UNICEF logo leads to different pages depending on the section. The data section has a different navbar, images are sometimes used as buttons, and breadcrumbs are often missing.

\hline
Filippo & 3 & Due to the presence of a lot of webpages, navigation is not consistent at all times. Breadcrumbs are not useful enough to solve this problem. The navigation bar is the only element that stays consistent and explains the hierarchy of the website.  \\
\hline
Virginia & 1 & You can navigate to a list of items to a specific item but coming back is not as straightforward. Navigation between groups is pretty much impossible without the navigation bar, and when done in one direction doesn't make it easy to go back.  \\
\hline
Mobina & 3 & It's usually easy to find a specific item from a list, but going back isn't always simple. Moving between different groups of content without using the navigation bar can be frustrating since it's not set up for easy backward navigation. Breadcrumbs are meant to help with navigation but don't always work well. On the other hand, the navigation bar is solid for showing how the site is organized.  \\
